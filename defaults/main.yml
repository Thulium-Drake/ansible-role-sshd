# Any extra required SSHD config files to be merged into a single file
# The resulting file is validated before the SSH server is restarted
#
# This module mainly allows for extra configuration, is does NOT override anything
# in the base configuration.
#
# The files are merged in the order they are listed in /etc/ssh/conf.d
# The base configuration is 00, but can be disabled

# List of files that have to be place on the server
# This variable is set by merging vars that end with _sshd_configs__to_merge
# to the list below. E.g.

#  - 02_sshd_allow_root_login
