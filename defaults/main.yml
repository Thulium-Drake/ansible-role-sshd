# Any extra required SSHD config files to be merged into a single file
# The resulting file is validated before the SSH server is restarted
#
# This module mainly allows for extra configuration, is does NOT override anything
# in the base configuration.
#
# This config is compliant with Mozilla Modern https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh and tuned to
# only support the most recent and secure algorithms. This configuration will work on Debian 10+ and RHEL8+

# The files are merged in the order they are listed in /etc/ssh/conf.d
# The base configuration is 00, but can be disabled
